# 100DaysofCode
This is my 100 days of code challenge. I will primarily focus on Python, but I may branch out.

I started learning from Dr. Angela Yu via Udemy with her course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023". This repository has my work starting on Day 3 of her program as well as other stuff I'll do.
